# Cursor IDE Rules

Load `/.context/ai-assistant-guide.md` before generating code.

## Mandatory Rules (T0)
- [ARCH-001]: Never create/modify files without human approval
- [ARCH-002]: Kernel (AGENTS.md) must remain < 5KB
- [ARCH-003]: Skills must be < 1400 tokens
- [ARCH-004]: Always cite sources in generated content
- [ARCH-005]: Maintain cross-model compatibility
- [ARCH-006]: Update MEMORY.md after significant actions

## Context Loading
Before starting work:
1. Load `/.context/standards/architectural-rules.md` (T0 rules)
2. Read `/.context/_meta/tech-stack.md` for project context
3. Review `MEMORY.md` for current state

## Code Generation
- Follow patterns in `/.context/patterns/architectural-overview.md`
- Apply standards from `/.context/standards/code-quality.md`
- Reference examples in `/.context/examples/` when relevant

## Testing
- Line coverage >= 90%
- Branch coverage >= 80%
- Follow testing strategy in `/.context/standards/testing-strategy.md`

## Workflow
- Use 6-phase pipeline for new skills/personas
- Route complex requests (>3 days effort) to Spec-Kit workflow
- Always show preview before proposing file changes
