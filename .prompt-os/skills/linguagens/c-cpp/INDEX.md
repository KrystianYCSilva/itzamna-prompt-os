## 📋 CONTENTS

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|------------|
| [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) | Foundational C/C++ concepts, syntax, memory model, compilation pipeline | Starting point for C/C++ fundamentals |
| [advanced-memory.md](advanced-memory.md) | Memory management, pointers, heap/stack, RAII, smart pointers | Working with memory safety and ownership patterns |
| [build-tools.md](build-tools.md) | Compilation tools (gcc, clang, MSVC), build systems (Make, CMake, Bazel) | Setting up build pipelines and project configuration |
| [compilation.md](compilation.md) | Compiler flags, optimization levels, linking, static vs dynamic libraries | Optimizing compilation and understanding linker behavior |

## 🎯 READING ORDER

1. **Start Here**: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — Understand C/C++ language basics
2. **If working with memory**: [advanced-memory.md](advanced-memory.md) — Dive into pointers, RAII, smart pointers
3. **If setting up projects**: [build-tools.md](build-tools.md) — Learn CMake, Make, build automation
4. **If optimizing**: [compilation.md](compilation.md) — Compiler flags, linker, performance tuning

## 📚 KEY CONCEPTS COVERED

- **Syntax & Types**: Primitive types, pointers, references, arrays, structs, classes
- **Memory Model**: Stack vs heap, lifetime, scope, smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)
- **RAII Pattern**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (safe resource management)
- **Build Systems**: CMake, Make, Bazel, compiler flags, linking strategies
- **Optimization**: -O levels, profiling, compiler intrinsics, linker optimization
