# AI Assistant Guide

This file provides system-level guidance for AI assistants operating on this repository. It should include the agent system prompt, reading order for critical files, and JIT loading guidance.

Suggested sections:
- System prompt & read order (ai-assistant-guide.md -> read first: .context/_meta/project-overview.md, CONSTITUTION.md, MEMORY.md)
- Human Gate rules and how to escalate decisions
- Where to write outputs (.context/, .prompt-os/skills/)

Populate with project-specific instructions as needed.
